## Overview:

## Objectives:
- Create a log in page.
- Create a place for you to review books.
- Create a home page for you to see previous reviews.
- be able to edit/delete reviews.


## Requirements:
- Be setup in two new repos (one for backend, one for front end) with separate development branches for each group member.
- Be a realistic idea. It cannot be anything we've created in class. It also cannot be from an online tutorial or walkthrough.
- Include a beautiful, professional ReadMe.md (use markdown).
- Your ReadMe should have your group members names, links to socials, a detailed description of your project, technologies used, a getting started section (with links to your deployed site and Trello), screenshots of your final product (no more than 2-3), future updates, and credits.
- Include a minimum of 3 Sequelize Models (models).
- At least one 1 to MANY or MANY to MANY association.
- Have full CRUD operations (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE) on at least one model.
- Integrate User Authentication with JWT and utilize protected routes on the frontend.
- Have at least 80 meaningful git commits - roughly 20+ per member utilizing branches and merging. You should be committing your changes to your branch every time you build a new feature, merging, and pulling them as a group.
- Your code should be properly indented, spaced, and within code blocks. DO NOT leave in commented out code that was left unused (bad practice).
- Both repos deployed on Heroku.
